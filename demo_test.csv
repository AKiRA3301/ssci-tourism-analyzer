Researchers could explore the moderating role of technology readiness in the relationship between travel motivation and tourist satisfaction.",carbon footprint; decision making; responsible tourism; tourism branding; travel motivation; e-tourism,17,10.1016/j.example.2024.605809
Exploring sustainable tourism in tourism: Evidence from Europe,"Wang, Y.; Anderson, P.",2024,2,International Journal of Hospitality Management,"This study examines the impact of augmented reality on sustainable tourism in the context of tourism. Using a sample of 268 tourists from Australia, we employed structural equation modeling to test our hypotheses. Results indicate that augmented reality significantly influences social media, with sustainable tourism playing a mediating role. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

The cross-sectional nature of this study limits causal inferences. Longitudinal studies are needed to examine temporal dynamics.

Rethinking loyalty: A new framework for virtual reality research,"Martinez, R.; Wang, Y.",2024,2,Tourism Geographies,"This paper explores the role of virtual reality in shaping eco-tourism among millennials. Through a mixed-methods approach, we found that revisit intention is a key determinant of tourist satisfaction. Implications for destination managers and future research directions are provided.

How does risk perception influence revisit intention? The mediating role of resilience,"Garcia, L.; Brown, M.; Zhang, H.; Martinez, R.",2025,12,Journal of Destination Marketing & Management,"This paper explores the role of revisit intention in shaping virtual reality among millennials. Through a mixed-methods approach, we found that community tourism is a key determinant of tourist satisfaction. Implications for destination managers and future research directions are provided.

The use of self-reported measures may introduce common method bias. Future studies should consider behavioral data.

word of mouth and tourist service quality: A systematic review,"Taylor, D.; Brown, M.; Lee, H.",2024,1,International Journal of Tourism Research,"Using big data analytics, we analyzed 268 online reviews to understand tourists' perceptions of place attachment. Topic modeling revealed 9 main themes, with revisit intention being the most frequently discussed. Sentiment analysis showed that attitudes toward carbon footprint are becoming more positive.

The cross-sectional nature of this study limits causal inferences. Longitudinal studies are needed to examine temporal dynamics.

Experimental designs could help establish causality between place attachment and behavioral outcomes.",place attachment; service quality; tourist satisfaction; word of mouth; carbon footprint; revisit intention,30,10.1016/j.example.2024.125685
